"""Fabricator design-assessment precondition (US-ARB-017).

Refuse fabrication when the target projectId has no completed
AgentDesignAssessment row (gov writes these rows). Composes
with US-ARB-010 quarantine: BOTH gates must pass before an agent is
fabricated — this gate runs FIRST, quarantine runs at store-time.

Forward-compatible design: when projectId is None (today's reality
since Citadel has no Project↔App linkage), the gate is a no-op. When
projectId is present (future), it queries the assessments table and
either permits or raises DesignAssessmentMissingError.

Grandfathering bypass: when grandfathered=True, the gate is skipped
regardless of assessment status. The caller is responsible for
resolving grandfathering upstream (it's a TypeScript helper — see
backend/src/utils/is-grandfathered.ts). Fabricator does NOT compute
grandfathering locally.

Spec: arbiter-governance-engine/requirements.md ARB-017 enrichment
(QE-1 resolution + gov-track coordination).
Plan: US-ARB-017 Δ7. PR label: needs-arbiter-review per QT4-10.
